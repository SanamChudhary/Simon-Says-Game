# Simon-Says-Game

Simon Says is a classic children's game where one player, the "leader" or "Simon," gives commands prefixed with "Simon says," which players must follow. Commands without "Simon says" should be ignored. Players who follow incorrect commands are out, and the last player standing wins. The game improves listening, attention, and quick thinking skills.
